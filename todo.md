NV Issues
==============

### externalizing hierarchy

### legend
- labels on color legend should change based on color option (requires some work on the color legend rendering)

### deployment
- Create a github page for nv 

### aesthetics
- add click pointer when mousing over histogram

### interaction

### bugs
- assigning a criticality/weight to individual machines has no effect.
- IPs should be in order on 'groups' tab
- some way to remove groups
- checking that groups don't overlap, how to handle if they do
- set weight to 0/'ignore' to remove machines from results?
