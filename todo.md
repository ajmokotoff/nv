- on mouseover, show both parent and child:
  - this does not currently work since .parent is above all the .child nodes and takes the mouseover hit
- add tipsy (fork john sent)
- add an indicator of where you are on color legend based on mouseover

- rewrite all the buttons using backbone
- run-nv does not work on ubuntu
