This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority. \n\nSecond, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate"s "notBefore" dates, or after one of the certificate"s "notAfter" dates. \n\nThird, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn"t match the certificate"s information, or was not possible to verify.

This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate"s "notBefore" dates, or after one of the certificate"s "notAfter" dates. \n\nThird, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn"t match the certificate"s information, or was not possible to verify.

This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority. \n\nSecond, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate"s "notBefore" dates, or after one of the certificate"s "notAfter" dates. \n\nThird, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn"t match the certificate"s information, or was not possible to verify.

This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority. \n\nSecond, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate"s "notBefore" dates, or after one of the certificate"s "notAfter" dates. \n\nThird, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn"t match the certificate"s information, or was not possible to verify.
