# Automated Generation And Analysis Of Attack Graphs
* Process:
    1. Determine vulnerable hosts.
    2. Determine connectivity between hosts.
    3. Produce attack graphs.
    4. Analysis
* Graph analysis is done using a finite state model.
* Transitions between nodes are atomic attacks.
* Find the minimum set of attacks to prevent to stop intruders.
    * Based on attack modeling
* Model checking
* NuSvm
