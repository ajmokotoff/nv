### Abstract
Network vulnerability is a critical component of network security. Yet vulnerability analysis has received relatively little attention from the security visualization community.  

### Introduction


Rather than monitoring a network to determine if an attack is occuring, analysts
Analysts who are aware of the

Increasingly, tools such as Nessus are used to assess networks.

Nv also allows analysts to specify specific groupings and criticality scores for machines in their network. This information is then used by to affect size and other visual features in the treemap, which helps ensure that the most important machines receive the most attention.

Specifically, our contributions to the field of security visualization are as follows:

- A visualization tool that supports security vulnerability awareness, analysis, and tracking
- A framework for building web-based visualizations that do not send sensitive data to servers

In the following section, we discuss related work in vulnerability visualization and analysis. Afterwards, we discuss the design of nv. We then present several case studies involving Nessus scans from multiple systems. We conclude with a brief discussion on web-based security visualization tools and on our future plans for nv.
