# NV Issues

1. Sometimes the label for the largest square will not render.
    * This bug is difficult to reproduce.
    * It seems to pop up when One square dominates the tree map such as when one
    group has a far higher criticality score than the others.
2.  Tree map disappears if you switch from the vis tab to the groups tab and
    back again.

- When a treemap node is small, the title (usually IP), can overlap with other nodes. The label should change based on node size (smaller, less text such as nixing 192.168, etcetera).
- When running comparisons, a key showing what the colors mean needs to appear.
- Any mouseover should change some information in some part of the page (useful for scanning).
