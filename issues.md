# NV Issues

1. Sometimes the label for the largest square will not render.
    * This bug is difficult to reproduce.
    * It seems to pop up when One square dominates the tree map such as when one
    group has a far higher criticality score than the others.
1.  Tree map disappears if you switch from the vis tab to the groups tab and
    back again.
