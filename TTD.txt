Non-critical bugs:

assigning a criticality/weight to individual machines has no effect.

IPs should be in order on 'groups' tab

Features to revisit sometime after submission:

some way to remove groups
checking that groups don't overlap, how to handle if they do
set weight to 0/'ignore' to remove machines from results?

some way to hide the second data tab, and go back to only one nbe file
