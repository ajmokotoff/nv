# Scalable, Graph-Based Network Vulnerability Analysis
* Use model checking for minimum exploit sets.
* Attack graphs represent more information than is needed and the attack tree
  step should be bypassed.
* Attack trees use nodes as the states and transitions are exploits.
* Models the attack such that the attacker never has to backtrack
* Partition model based on initially satisfied and unsatisfied attributes
