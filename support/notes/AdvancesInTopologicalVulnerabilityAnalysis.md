# Advances in Topological Vulnerability Analysis
* Goal is to model possible attack vectors.
* Based on models of network vulnerabilities and potential exploits.
* Approach:
    * _Network Capture_ builds a model of the network in terms of security
    attributes.
    * _Exploit Conditions_ encode how each vulnerability may be exploited and
    the result.
    * _Graph Engine_ and _Environment Model_ simulate multi-step attacks through
    the network for a scenario.
* Integrates with Nessus.
* Visualization:
    * Graphs can quickly become too complex.
    * Aggregate graphs for better situational awareness.
    * _Protection domain_ represents a set of machines with full access to other
    machine's vulnerabilities.
    * Highlights these important machines
    * Uses something similar to the tree map.
    * Aggregates groups of machines and then these groups can be expanded.
    * Displays changes to the graph when a machine is "hardened". 
    * Always maintains an overview of the entire graph
