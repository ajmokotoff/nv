To run nv, you can use the built in script or use your own web server.

To run using the built in script, have [node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed and simply run `run_nv`. If a browser is not launched automatically, go to http://localhost:8000/ in a browser.

To run using your own web server, just start in the current directory. For example, to use [Python's http server](http://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html), run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` and go to http://localhost:8000/ in a browser.
