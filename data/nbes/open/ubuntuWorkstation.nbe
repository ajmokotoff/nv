This allows an attacker to know the date that is set on the targeted machine, which may assist an unauthenticated, remote attacker in defeating time-based authentication protocols.\n\nTimestamps returned from machines running Windows Vista / 7 / 2008 / 2008 R2 are deliberately incorrect, but usually within 1000 seconds of the actual system time.\n\nSolution :\n\nFilter out the ICMP timestamp requests (13), and the outgoing ICMP timestamp replies (14).\n\nRisk factor :\n\nNone\n\nPlugin output :\nThe difference between the local and remote clocks is 2 seconds.\n\n\nCVE : CVE-1999-0524\nOther references : OSVDB:94,CWE:200\n
